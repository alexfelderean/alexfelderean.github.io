            <a>I'm a mix of all things co-disciplinary: a storyteller, designer, engineer, biologist, and photographer. I’m passionate about creating experiences that bring attention to the mystery, wonder, and beauty of the in-betweens. I’m currently working as a freelance art director and creative consultant for companies in the biology and beauty spaces. Previously, I led Ginkgo Bioworks’ brand and visual design team, where I collaborated with creatives to visualize what it means to design</a>
