            <h1>Hi! I'm Alex Felderean.</h1>
            <br>
            <a>I'm a second year Honors student studying Computer Science and Engineering at the Ohio State University.
            Alongside my classwork, I spend time organizing events through the </a><a href="https://cpcosu.github.io">Competative Programming Club</a><a>, designing prosthetics for </a><a href="http://org.osu.edu/d90/">Design For 90</a><a> with biology in mind, and developing new opportunities within </a><a href="https://hack.osu.edu">OHI/O</a><a> hackathons.
            <br><br>
            In addition, I currently work for multiple departments at Ohio State.
            I am a lab teaching assistant within the </a><a href="https://engineering.osu.edu/undergraduate/engineering-honors">Honors Engineering program</a><a>, working alongside faculty to provide enriching experiences through a variety of disciplines.
            I am also a data archive assistant within </a><a href="https://pare.osu.edu/services/facilities-information-and-technology-services">FITS</a><a>, helping manage metadata within the university's architectural database.
            <br><br>
            Outside of my studies, I am always looking to further explore the world around me.
            Playing the piano, creating 2D artwork, and swimming have been some staple hobbies of mine for many years.
            But recently, I have also invested myself into new avenues of software development, artistic representation, and visual design.
